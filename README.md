# CHILS &mdash; Concurrent Hybrid Iterated Local Search

## Ernestine Gro√ümann, Kenneth Langedal, and Christian Schulz

Compile the project by running
```
make
```
There are no dependencies besides an OpenMP-compatible compiler. Adjust the CC variable in the Makefile if you prefer another compiler than GCC.

Running make will produce an executable called CHILS.
